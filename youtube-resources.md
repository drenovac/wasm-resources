- [Flutter, Dart, and WASM-GC: A new model for Web applications by Kevin Moore @ Wasm I/O 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkjc9r0WDNo) - Support for garbage collection within WebAssembly (WASM-GC) will bring a host of new languages and frameworks to the web app space. Learn how the Dart and Flutter teams at Google are building on WASM-GC (among other upcoming standards) to bring richer, faster, more consistent applications to the web

Until now, WASM-compiled browser applications have been mostly limited to systems programming languages – allowing a number of traditionally desktop experiences to run on the web. (Think AutoCad, PhotoShop, Google Earth.) The implementation of WASM-GC across WASM runtimes will bring a set of new languages and frameworks to an ecosystem dominated by C/C++ and Rust. The open source Dart and Flutter projects at Google have spent over a year adding WebAssembly as a target platform with the hope of improving application load time and interactive performance for Flutter experiences on the web. This talk will cover how WASM-GC expands the WASM ecosystem, some details on how Flutter and Dart approached migrating our existing JS-compiled web support to WebAssembly, and our hopes for a ecosystem that embraces WASM-GC across the browser and server to enable a more portable, secure, and interoperable future of computer systems.

- [From Cloud to Edge computing - Unleashing the power of WebAssembly at the edge by Alex Casalboni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEWMVFQjHcw) - In this session, we’ll dive deep into how WebAssembly enables lightweight, secure, and fast compute workloads at the edge, with an emphasis on real-world use cases that leverage Rust’s unique strengths for predictable performance and memory safety, while coexisting with cloud resources. We’ll showcase the architectural tradeoff and technical challenges we face at 
Edgee such as data sovereignty and security constraints to power features such as data collection and dynamic A/B testing.
We’ll share how we optimized our open-source Rust-based WebAssembly components for edge deployment. Join us to discover how to build architectures that seamlessly blend cloud and edge, unlocking a new level of responsiveness and efficiency.
